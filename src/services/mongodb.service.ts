 *
 * Integration Adapter Service for MongoDB Atlas (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §7
 * "Integration Adapter Services", §183 — adapters own connection handling,
 * timeouts, retries, provider error normalization, and health reporting).
 *
 * Connection model: a single MongoClient shared process-wide. The official
 * driver already maintains an internal connection pool, so creating a client
 * per call or per request is the documented anti-pattern — one client is
 * reused and connected lazily on first use.
 *
 * Configuration is read from the environment (MONGODB_URI, DB_NAME) at
 * connect time rather than at import time, so importing this module never
 * throws and the server can still boot when Mongo is not configured. The
 * failure surfaces on first use, where it can be reported to a caller.
 *
 * TODO(housing): no retry/backoff policy, circuit breaker, or health-check
 * registration yet — docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §183 requires all three at the
 * adapter boundary before production use.
 * TODO(housing): provider errors are surfaced as-is. They must be normalized
 * into the application error taxonomy (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §16) so callers
 * never depend on driver-specific error shapes.
 * TODO(housing): every collection needs explicit indexes, tenant boundaries,
 * and retention/soft-delete rules per docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §487. This slice
 * creates none.
